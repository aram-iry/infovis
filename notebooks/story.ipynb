        "For decades, whales have captivated both scientists and the public, their size and grace emblematic of the mysteries of the deep sea. Yet beneath the waves, these marine giants face mounting threats, many of them driven by human activity. Whales are vital to ocean health, playing key roles in food webs and the global carbon cycle. But over the past century, industrial-scale fishing and global shipping have introduced risks that now endanger the survival of many species. As demand for seafood and marine transport grows, so too do concerns about the sustainability of these industries and their impact on whale populations worldwide (Block & Amudson, 2020).\n",
        "\n",
        "While oversea transport and fishing is crucial for global trade, global food security, and coastal livelihoods, its side effects are increasingly hard to ignore. One particularly serious issue is whale bycatch, the accidental capture of whales in fishing gear. Combined with overlapping marine traffic and habitat disruption, these pressures raise urgent questions about how to balance marine resource use with conservation. Despite growing awareness, the scale and impact of these interactions remain difficult to quantify. (Moore et al., 2012)\n",
        "\n",
        "To shed light on this issue, we analyzed data from multiple marine datasets covering whale bycatch, whale and ship activity, and fishing activity across several regions and years. Our goal was to understand the scale and geography of interactions between whales and human activity on sea. In doing so, we aimed to identify which whale species are most exposed, which regions pose the highest risk, if the problem has gotten somewhat better over the years, and how data-driven policy could help protect marine life while supporting sustainable fishing practices."

        "From 1960 to the late 1980s, global capture fisheries production experienced a steady and steep rise, growing from around 300 million metric tons to over 700 million. This surge coincided with post-war technological advances in fishing vessels, sonar tracking, and cold storage, tools that allowed fleets to venture farther and stay out longer. The 1980s and 1990s marked a second, steeper climb, with production peaking around 2000, approaching nearly 1 billion metric tons annually (Pauly et al., 2005).\n",
        "\n",
        "But the graph also tells a subtler story: since around 2000, global capture production has plateaued, with slight fluctuations but no sustained increase. This leveling off suggests that most of the world's major fisheries have reached or exceeded their sustainable limits. Declines after 2015 in some years may even hint at early signs of nature consideration or stock collapses in certain regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For whales, this upward curve in fishing activity directly correlates with a rise in threats such as bycatch, gear entanglement, and habitat disruption. More fishing effort means more gear in the water, more ship traffic, and less available food in some shared ecosystems. Importantly, this global trend does not represent a uniform threat; certain regions and species are more exposed than others, as other graphs in this study show.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, this graph captures the historical momentum behind today's marine pressures. While fisheries are essential for food security and livelihoods, their exponential growth over the past half-century has created widespread and systemic risks for marine megafauna like whales. Understanding these long-term trends helps frame the urgency for sustainable management, not just of fisheries, but of all life that shares the sea."

Although production has plateaued since 2000, the threat remains: fishing gear continues to entangle and kill whales, often unintentionally, through bycatch. Certain species, like the False Killer Whale, suffer disproportionately, making up over 55% of recorded bycatch-related mortalities.\n",
