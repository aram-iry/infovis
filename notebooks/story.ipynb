    "Whales are majestic creatures that are vital to ocean health, playing key roles in food webs and the global carbon cycle. But over the past century, industrial-scale fishing and global shipping have introduced risks that now endanger the survival of many species. As demand for seafood and marine transport grows, so too do concerns about the sustainability of these industries and their impact on whale populations worldwide (Block & Amudson, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "While oversea transport and fishing is crucial for global trade, global food security, and coastal livelihoods, its side effects, such as whale bycatch, marine traffic and habitat disruption are increasingly hard to ignore. \n",
    "These pressures raise urgent questions about how to balance marine resource use with conservation. Yet despite increased attention, the full extent and evolution of these interactions are still not well understood (Moore et al., 2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore these dynamics, we analyzed marine data on whale sightings, fishing activity, and ship movements across multiple regions and years. Our goal was to understand the scale and geography of interactions between whales and human activity on sea. By presenting both ecological and economic perspectives, we hope to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how marine space can be managed to serve multiple priorities."

    "We began by examining the scale of the global fishing industry to provide context for the data story. Understanding how large and widespread fisheries have become over the past decades helps frame the intensity of human activity in marine environments. This sets the stage for exploring how industrial fishing may intersect with whale presence and other ecological factors, and why managing shared ocean space has become an increasingly complex challenge."

    "From 1960 to the late 1980s, global capture fisheries production experienced a steady and steep rise, growing from around 300 million metric tons to over 700 million. This surge coincided with post-war technological advances in fishing vessels, sonar tracking, and cold storage, tools that allowed fleets to venture farther and stay out longer. The 1980s and 1990s marked a second, steeper climb, with production peaking around 2000, approaching nearly 1 billion metric tons annually (Pauly et al., 2005).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since around 2000, global capture production has plateaued, with slight fluctuations but no sustained increase. This leveling off suggests that most of the world's major fisheries have reached or exceeded their sustainable limits, whether ecological (e.g. overfishing), regulatory, or technological.\n",
    "\n",
    "For whales, this upward curve in fishing activity directly correlates with a rise in threats such as bycatch, gear entanglement, and habitat disruption. More fishing effort means more gear in the water, more ship traffic, and less available food in some shared ecosystems. Importantly, this global trend does not represent a uniform threat; certain regions and species are more exposed than others, as other graphs in this study show."

    "Whales face an array of threats in today's ocean, many of which are driven by human activity. Global fisheries production has increased dramatically since the mid-20th century, expanding into new regions and intensifying the risks for marine mammals. Although production has plateaued since 2000, the threat remains: fishing gear continues to entangle and kill whales, often unintentionally, through bycatch. Certain species, like the False Killer Whale, suffer disproportionately, making up over 55% of recorded bycatch-related mortalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond bycatch, ship strikes also present a major hazard, especially in heavily trafficked waters. These incidents, though less visible, are often fatal and underreported. Combined with historical and in some cases ongoing whale catching, these pressures push many populations toward endangerment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global map of marine ship activity illustrates how regions with the highest yields often overlap with whale migratory routes, intensifying the risk. Ultimately, whale endangerment isn't caused by one factor, but a convergence of industrial fishing, vessel traffic, and insufficient regulation.\n",
