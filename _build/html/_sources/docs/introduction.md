# Introduction

The world's oceans are home to some of the most majestic and mysterious creatures on Earth - whales. These animals play a crucial role in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems, from regulating food chains to supporting the carbon cycle. However, human activities, including industrial fishing, overseas shipping, resource extraction, and pollution, are placing growing pressure on whale populations across the globe.

Modern fishing industries and overseas transport practices are essential for food security and coastal economies around the world. Yet, they can also lead to unintended consequences, such as the entanglement of whales in fishing gear, habitat disruption, and ship strikes. These impacts, while often underreported, raise important questions about how to balance marine resource use with species conservation.

This data story explores the relationship between marine human activity and whales from two perspectives: the ecological urgency to protect vulnerable species, and the practical realities of sustaining ocean-based industries. Using recent data and case studies, we aim to identify where and how these interactions occur, which species are most affected, and what strategies might reduce harm while supporting both ecological health and the long-term viability of coastal communities, global trade, and marine economies.
