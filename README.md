# Information Visualisation: The Impact of Human Activity on Whale Populations

Our datastory explores the relationship between whales and human activity at sea, including fishing and shipping. Using a range of marine datasets, we visualise trends in global fisheries, protein consumption, ship strike risk, and whale vulnerability, offering a balanced view of both economic and ecological perspectives.

## What's inside?
- Interactive graphs and maps based on cleaned, publicly available datasets
- A structured narrative that moves from economic importance to ecological impacts
- Insights into how marine industries and whale conservation intersect globally

## Structure
- All data processing and visualisation code is stored in Jupyter notebooks
- Each visualisation has its own notebook for easy maintenance
- The full narrative is assembled in a single story notebook
