### DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: fit_ISDM.R

1. Description: Worked example code to fit whale integrated species distribution model (ISDM) incorporating survey, sightings, whaling records, and tagging data. Code includes data formatting and setup, model fitting, model validation, and spatial prediction and visualization. This script is applied to blue_whale_isdm_data.csv and the csv files within the prediction_data_north_pacific folder.
