# Reflection

## Feedback
On 17 June, we had a peer review with group A3 where we had to give a short pitch about our project. Then we were assessed by the other group.

We received compliments on the cleanliness and coherence of our graphs and the layout of our website. No areas for improvement were mentioned.

In addition, our draft was reviewed by our TA, who was also very positive about the project. It was mentioned that the heatmaps in the ocean should not be in our blue theme, as this could be confusing for readers. We implemented this feedback and changed the colour theme in this heatmap to another colour. 

Furthermore, as a general comment, not specific to our project, it was mentioned that we should pay a lot of attention to the rubric and to getting rid of error messages. We found all feedback valid, so we incorporated everything thoroughly and kept the general ideas behind the feedback in mind.

## Self-reflection

Overall, we are satisfied with the datastory we wrote. A nice, two-sided story emerged from our research about the consideration between fishing and protecting whales. However, we did run into a few problems:

- Finding good datasets on whales. Looking for data was very time intensive as observing whales globally is not prioritised in science. Especially at the beginning, we put a lot of effort into working towards irrelevant findings; we learned from this by first reading up on the datasets we were using and their limitations with thoroughly. 
- Data did not match our expectations. This meant we sometimes had to adjust our story to make it more nuanced.
- Some visualizations were first made with libraries that did not correctly work in the Jupyter Book. However, these were mostly easy fiex
