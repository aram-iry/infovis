# Reflection

## (Peer) feedback
On 17 June, we had a peer review with group A3, where we had to give a short pitch about our project. Then we were assessed by the other group.

We received compliments on the cleanliness and coherence of our graphs and the layout of our website. No areas for improvement were mentioned.

In addition, our draft was also reviewed by our TA, he was also very positive about the project. It was mentioned that it looked clean and professional. However, it was mentioned that the heatmaps in the ocean should not be in our blue theme, as this can be associated with water, which is confusing for readers. We took this feedback on board and changed the colour theme in this heatmap to another colour. Furthermore, as a general comment, not specific to our project, it was mentioned that we should pay a lot of attention to the rubric and to getting rid of error messages. We found all feedback valid, so we incorporated everything thoroughly and kept the general ideas behind the feedback in mind.

## Self-reflection

Overall, we are satisfied with the datastory we wrote. A nice, two-sided story emerged from our research about the consideration between fishing and protecting whales. However, we did run into a number of problems.

Most importantly, there was a limited number of good datasets on whales. A lot of time was spent trying to find suitable datasets, this was unfortunately very difficult as observing whales globally is not prioritised in science. An example of a bad dataset was a dataset with geographical coordinates, which afterwards showed that after plotting, was a regional dataset. Especially at the beginning, we put a lot of effort into working towards irrelevant findings; we learned from this by first reading up on the datasets we were using and their limitations with thoroughly. 

In addition, we also sometimes noticed that we had found data that did not match our expectations, for example, we had underestimated how important fish production is to the nutrition of people worldwide. So, we sometimes adjusted our story to make it more nuanced.
