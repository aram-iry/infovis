# Dataset and preprocessing

To support our datastory with credible evidence, we used different sources to find relevant datasets that aligned with our topic, such as conservation databases, regional fisheries management databases, etc. We aimed to find data that was recent, diverse and comprehensive in scope in order to cover both aspects of the fishing industry and its documented impacts on whale populations.

## Cleaning

We cleaned datasets that contained diverse animal species (such as a dataset including species' populations trends and endangerment status and a dataset on bycatch of different species) by filtering them to isolate whale species and exclude extraneous entries. We used ChatGPT to extract the relevant whale species' names from the set of animal species' names and then used Python and pandas to extract these from the datasets.

## Aggregations

For some datasets, aggregating was not necessary as they were usable in their original form.
