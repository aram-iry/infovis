# Introduction

Whales play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, but face increasing threats from industrial fishing and shipping activities (Block & Amudson, 2020). While industrial fishing and shipping support global food supplies and economies, these same industries drive whale population declines through ship collisions, gear entanglement, and habitat destruction (Moore et al., 2012).

This story examines two perspectives: 
On one hand, many whale species remain endangered, suggesting current protections are inadequate. Industrial fishing and shipping threaten these animals, especially in narrow habitats or migration paths. Stronger regulations, like bycatch limits and ship speed reductions, could be vital. 
On the other hand, whale protection must be balanced with economic realities. Fishing and shipping are crucial for food security. Rather than strict bans, sustainable coexistence strategies like safer gear, whale tracking, and compensations could offer a more practical path forward.
