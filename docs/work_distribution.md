# Work Distribution

As a team we communicated mostly by meeting up and text, but also by seeing each other at
seminars. In our first meeting (aimed to create our proposal), we sat down and searched for
datasets together, which we could base our project off of. Our initial idea was to create something
related to whales, which we were fortunate enough to actually fulfill. With this subject in mind we
found datasets and started discussing potential visualizations we could create. The visualizations
were then created, and this gave us a general idea of where we wanted to take the data story, so 
there would be a complete narrative around these graphs, which eventually led to our draft. The rest of
the time we had for this project was used to improve areas like design of the Jupyter Notebook, the data story
itself, and the visualizations. Then considering all the feedback we could get our hands on, we created the final data story.

## Aram
Aram worked on creating several visualisations. On top of that, he worked on aggregating several datasets. He also presented the draft during the feedback round and contributed heavily on writing the reflection. Furthermore, he helped writing the text in the data story.

## Thomas

Initially helped with finding datasets we could base our story on, helped create some of the graphs and wrote most of the data story in general. In the last week of the project I assisted in finishing up, making sure every little detail was correct.
