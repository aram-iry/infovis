# Work Distribution

As a team we communicated mostly by meeting up and text, but also by seeing each other at
seminars. In our first meeting (aimed to create our proposal), we sat down and searched for
datasets together, which we could base our project off of. Our initial idea was to create something
related to whales, which we were fortunate enough to actually fulfill. With this subject in mind we
found datasets and started discussing potential visualizations we could create. The visualizations
were then created, and this gave us a general idea of where we wanted to take the data story, so 
there would be a complete narrative around these graphs, which eventually led to our draft. The rest of
the time we had for this project was used to improve areas like design of the Jupyter Notebook, the data story
itself, and the visualizations. Then considering all the feedback we could get our hands on, we created the final data story.

## Aram
Aram worked on creating several visualisations. On top of that, he worked on aggregating several datasets. He also presented the draft during the feedback round and wrote the <i>Reflection</i> section. Furthermore, he helped writing the text in the data story.

## Fien
Fien initially looked for datasets which she used to create several visualisations. She also wrote the <i>Introduction</i> and <i>Dataset and Preprocessing</i> sections, and helped in writing the data story itself. In addition, she focused on the overall presentation and aesthetics of the book and took a final editing role to perfect the visualizations and book in general.

## Thomas

Initially helped with finding datasets we could base our story on, helped create several graphs and wrote most of the data story in general. In the last week of the project he assisted in finishing up, making sure every little detail was correct.

## Mina
Mina looked for multiple datasets, of which she aggregated several. She used these aggregated datasets to create some visualisations. During the feedback round she also answered most questions. Additionally, she helped write the datastory.
