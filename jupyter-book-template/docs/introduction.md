# Introduction

The world's oceans are home to some of the most majestic and mysterious creatures on Earth - whales. These gentle giants play a crucial role in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems, from regulating food chains to supporting the carbon cycle. However, industrial fishing practices are increasingly putting pressure on whale populations around the world.

As global demand for seafood continues to rise, fishing operations have expanded in scale, intensity, and reach, often leading to unintended consequences for non-target species. Whales can become entangled in fishing gear, suffer from habitat disruption, or be affected by underwater noise generated by vessels and equipment. These impacts are often underreported and not always visible in public discussions about sustainability in the fishing industry.

This data story explores how modern fishing practices affect whales. Using available data and case studies, we highlight where and how these interactions occur, which species are most affected, and what the broader ecological implications may be.
