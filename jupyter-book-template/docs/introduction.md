# Introduction

The world's oceans are home to some of the most majestic and mysterious creatures on Earth - whales. These animals play a crucial role in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems, from regulating food chains to supporting the carbon cycle. However, industrial fishing practices are increasingly putting pressure on whale populations around the world.

Modern fishing industries are essential for food security and coastal economies around the world. Yet, they can also lead to unintended consequences, such as the entanglement of whales in fishing gear, habitat disruption, and increased underwater noise. These impacts, while often underreported, raise important questions about how to balance marine resource use with species conservation.

This data story explores the relationship between industrial fishing and whales from two perspectives: the ecological urgency to protect vulnerable species, and the practical realities faced by the fishing industry. By drawing on recent data and case studies, we aim to highlight where and how these interactions occur, which species are most affected, and what potential solutions may help reduce harm while maintaining a sustainable seafood supply.
